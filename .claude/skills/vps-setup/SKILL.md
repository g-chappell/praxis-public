# /vps-setup

One-time bootstrap on the VPS. Converts a bare Ubuntu/Debian host into a
working autonomous-dev VPS with the project's app and CC agent both running
under systemd.

**Not idempotent for destructive ops** — always reviews before `apt install`
or overwriting `/etc/nginx/*`. But fully safe to re-run: re-detects what's
already installed and skips.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22+ or Debian 12+
- User with sudo
- Current directory is the cloned project repo at `/opt/<slug>/`
- `.claude/project.json` already filled by `/init-autonomous` Phase 2 (at
  least `project.slug`, `project.name`, `deploy.*`, `host.serviceName`)

## Phases

### 1. Detect + confirm

Run:
```bash
lsb_release -a                       # Ubuntu/Debian?
whoami                                # current user
groups | grep -E "sudo|docker"        # sudo + docker groups
which docker nginx gh node            # which tools already installed
systemctl --version                   # systemd?
```

Print findings, ask user to confirm before any install.

### 2. Install missing dependencies

For each missing tool, prompt before installing:

```bash
# Docker (official)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# (logout + login required to pick up group; tell user)

# nginx
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx

# gh CLI
# Follow https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

# Node 20 (for roadmap scripts + CC agent)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

### 3. gh auth

```bash
gh auth login
```

Prompt user to follow the interactive flow; verify with `gh auth status`.

### 4. Environment variables (.env)

If `.env` doesn't exist, copy from `.env.example` and prompt the user for
each required secret one at a time. Never log the values. Write to `.env`
with mode 0600.

Required at minimum:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — for the autonomous agent
- Any DB credentials, app secrets the user has from `.env.example`

Auto-generate if blank in `.env.example` (do not prompt — random is strictly
better than a human-chosen string for these):

- `NTFY_TOPIC` — per-project push-notification topic. Public-by-URL, so
  the randomness is the only secret. Generate with:

  ```bash
  echo "NTFY_TOPIC={{slug}}-agent-$(openssl rand -hex 8)" >> .env
  ```

  Collision-proof across projects (the slug prefix disambiguates) and
  unguessable (the 16-hex-char suffix).

### 5. Systemd units for Claude Code

Two units per project. Both are slug-namespaced so multiple autonomous-dev
projects can coexist on one VPS without collision.

#### 5a. `claude-{{slug}}.service` — scheduled dev-cycle oneshot

Write `/etc/systemd/system/claude-{{slug}}.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Claude Code autonomous agent for {{project_name}}
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User={{os_user}}
WorkingDirectory=/opt/{{slug}}
EnvironmentFile=/opt/{{slug}}/.env
# Marker for .claude/hooks/userprompt-cycle-guard.mjs so the hook skips
# itself when the session is the autonomous cycle (prevents the cycle
# from warning about itself + bailing out on its own /autonomous-run).
Environment=AUTODEV_AUTONOMOUS_CYCLE=1
# The actual CC CLI command; adjust for your CC install location:
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/claude-code --scheduled
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### 5b. `claude-rc-{{slug}}.service` — persistent Remote Control server

Copy `systemd/claude-rc.service.tmpl` from the project scaffold to
`/etc/systemd/system/claude-rc-{{slug}}.service`, substituting `{{slug}}`.
This gives the mobile Claude app a per-project entry named
`{{slug}}-vps`. The unit includes:

- `--name {{slug}}-vps` — the session-name prefix the mobile app shows.
  One per project keeps sessions distinguishable and prevents two
  daemons from registering under the same relay key.
- `Restart=always` + `RuntimeMaxSec=21600` — periodic recycle every 6 h
  to avoid relay-registration drift (observed: long-lived RC daemons
  become unreachable from mobile after ~11 h; forced recycle fixes it).
- `KillSignal=SIGINT` + `TimeoutStopSec=10` — graceful disconnect on
  stop so stale session entries don't accumulate in the mobile app.

#### 5c. `claude-pty-{{slug}}.service` — interactive console broker (only if autodev-mcp is on this VPS)

Spawns a `claude` PTY on demand when the dashboard's
`/dashboard/projects/:slug/console` page is opened. The broker binary
itself ships with `autodev-mcp` (`/opt/autodev-mcp/dist/pty/cli.js`) —
only the unit and env vars are per-slug. Idle when no client is
connected: zero token cost, zero CPU.

Skip this phase if `/opt/autodev-mcp/dist/pty/cli.js` doesn't exist on
this VPS — the dashboard's console page just stays unreachable.

Copy `systemd/claude-pty.service.tmpl` from the project scaffold to
`/etc/systemd/system/claude-pty-{{slug}}.service`, substituting
`{{slug}}`, `{{project_name}}`, and `{{os_user}}`. Don't `--now` start
it here — §5e enrolls the project user in the `autodev-mcp` group, and
the broker's `SupplementaryGroups=autodev-mcp` directive needs that
group membership to resolve.

#### 5d. Reload + enable

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable claude-{{slug}}.service
sudo systemctl enable --now claude-rc-{{slug}}.service
# Don't start claude-{{slug}}.service yet — user should flip
# schedule.enabled in project.json first. RC can start immediately so
# the mobile app can pair.
# claude-pty-{{slug}}.service is enabled+started in §5e, after the
# autodev-mcp group enrollment.
```

#### 5e. autodev-mcp group enrollment + start pty broker (if MCP is on this VPS)

If `autodev-mcp-http.service` is running on this VPS, add the project's
service user to the `autodev-mcp` group so the per-cycle stdio MCP
subprocess can write to the shared SQLite at `/opt/autodev-mcp/var/`,
**and** so the pty broker's `SupplementaryGroups=autodev-mcp` directive
resolves at start time:

```bash
if id autodev-mcp >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  sudo usermod -a -G autodev-mcp {{os_user}}
  # Group membership is picked up on next login / next service start —
  # claude-{{slug}}.service hasn't been started yet, so no further
  # action needed there.
  # Now start the pty broker if §5c installed it:
  if [ -f /etc/systemd/system/claude-pty-{{slug}}.service ]; then
    sudo systemctl enable --now claude-pty-{{slug}}.service
  fi
fi
```

Without this the cycle still completes locally (Step 5 / Step 10 mirrors
are best-effort) but emits "MCP mirror failed (readonly DB)" in the
journal and rows never reach the dashboard, and the dashboard console
page returns 502 (no broker socket). Skip this phase if the VPS doesn't
yet host autodev-mcp; add the user later when the MCP server is
provisioned.

### 6. nginx reverse proxy

Copy `docker/nginx.conf` to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{slug}}.conf` and
link:

```bash
sudo cp docker/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{slug}}.conf
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{slug}}.conf \
           /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/{{slug}}.conf
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 7. TLS (optional)

Prompt: "Enable HTTPS via Let's Encrypt now? [Y/n]"

If yes:
```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d {{app_domain}}
```

### 8. First deploy verification

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh          # build + up + health check
bash scripts/healthcheck.sh     # independent verification
```

If health check passes: done. Print next steps:

```
VPS setup complete.

Next:
  1. Flip schedule.enabled to true in .claude/project.json
     (or via: mcp__scheduled-tasks__update_scheduled_task)
  2. sudo systemctl start claude-{{slug}}
  3. Watch: sudo journalctl -u claude-{{slug}} -f

Troubleshooting:
  - App logs:     docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f app
  - nginx logs:   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  - CC agent:     sudo journalctl -u claude-{{slug}} -n 100
```

## Failure modes

- **User not in `docker` group:** installer adds them, but group membership
  only takes effect on new login. Tell the user to `exit` and SSH back in.
- **systemd not available:** e.g. Alpine, some container hosts. Fall back
  to writing a `/root/claude-{{slug}}.sh` loop script and suggest running
  it in `tmux` — but warn about lack of auto-restart.
- **SELinux enforcing on RHEL-family:** not covered; refer to
  `docs/VPS-SETUP.md` troubleshooting.
- **nginx conflict with existing site:** detect if `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`
  exists; offer to disable it.
- **Firewall blocking:** check `ufw status`; offer `sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp`.
